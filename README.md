![](/docs/welcome.png)

Zest For Ride API provides a backend database to have a complete CRUD(create, read, update, delete) functionality for users to work with data, and it was created for Zest For Ride React app.

The overall structure of the project was modeled based on Code Institutes [drf-api](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api) walkthrough, with additional functionality added by me.

# Entity Relationship Diagram
Before starting the project, I conducted thorough research to define the data models needed for the application. This involved identifying entities, relationships, and creating a comprehensive list of fields and actions required for the app to function correctly. With this information, I built the necessary models, ensuring the application meets its goals.
