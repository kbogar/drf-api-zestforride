# Zest For Ride API

![](/docs/welcome.png)

Zest For Ride API provides a backend database to have a complete CRUD(create, read, update, delete) functionality for users to work with data, and it was created for Zest For Ride React app.

The overall structure of the project was modeled based on Code Institutes [drf-api](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api) walkthrough, with additional functionality added by me.
